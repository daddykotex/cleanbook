If you have W3TC, and have an UNEXPECTED TOKEN ILLEGAL ERROR. The minifying process of W3TC had problem with underscore.min.js at the time I wrote this. Adding this file to the excluded list of minified js in your W3TC configuration should fix it.

The name I used is : wp-includes/js/underscore.min.js
